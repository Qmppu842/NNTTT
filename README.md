# NNTTT
NNTTT = Neural network tictactoe

Probable implementation:  
 - input layer: 9 nodes that each represent one square of tictactoe  
 - hidden layer(s): their name is not hidden for nothing...  
 - output layer: 9 nodes that are numbers from 0 to 1 representing where should next move go, thus only one node should light up per input.  
  
  
Notes:  
  - For easy inputting data one should represent tictactoe as list.
